# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage of UFO sighting data that could be used by a data journalist named Dana to write an article about McMinnville, Oregon.  Javascript was used to create multiple functions that would take in UFO sighting data and filter it on the different IDs listed, such as date, city, or state.  An HTML file was then created to display this data and the Javascript functions as a webpage in order for users to interact with and seek out UFO sightings from different dates and areas.  Additionally, Bootstrap elements were added to the HTML code to display the data in a grid form, as well as to customize the webpage visually.

# Results
The completed webpage created in this project can be used to filter the UFO data present based on five criteria – the date, city, state, and country in which the sighting occurred, as well as the shape of the UFO sighted.  The image below shows an example of this function being carried out.  On the left, the five fields are available for user input, and in the example “atlanta” is entered in the “City” field to filter the table for sightings in the city Atlanta.

# Summary
While this webpage does well to filter the UFO data for specific instances a user might be looking for, one potential drawback is being unable to show a range of instances.  Further development options could be including the ability to filter for a range of dates, or filtering for multiple states at a time.
